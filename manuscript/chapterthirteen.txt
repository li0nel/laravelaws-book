# **13. (Optional) Updating your stack manually &mdash; vertical scaling or manual horizontal scaling**


To create your CloudFormation stack the first time, use the below command:


![](code/chapterthirteen1.rb)



If you later want to modify the number or size of the instances in your cluster, update the parameters *ECSInstanceType* and *ECSDesiredCount* in your command line and call the *update-stack*command instead. CloudFormation will un-provision your previous instances and launch the new instances without further intervention needed from you.
