# **11. (Optional) High availability for the storage tier**
As we discussed previously, we only have one database instance and no read replica in a separate AZ. You can add a replica in CloudFormation with the below template:


![](code/chaptereleven1.rb)


C> `Use the DependsOn directive to avoid your replica to be instantiated before and be promoted as the primary instance by Aurora`


Note that Aurora only supports instances starting at db.r4.large size for PostgreSQL whereas Aurora MySQL does start at db.t2.small instances.
