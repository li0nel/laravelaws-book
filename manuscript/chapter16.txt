# 16. (Optional) Setup SES and a mail server

If you've bought your domain name from Route53 instead of another domain name registrar, you don't have a mail service ie you can't receive emails on your new domain name. AWS has no other solution for you than letting you host a mail server on an EC2 instance and get your MX records to point at it, or to set up a custom Lambda function to redirect your incoming emails to GMail for example.
