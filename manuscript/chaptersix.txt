# **6. Launch a bastion &amp; run database migrations**


A bastion (also called jump box) is a temporary EC2 instance that we will place in a public subnet of our VPC. It will enable us to SSH into it from outside the VPC and from there still being able to access our instances (including database instances) in private subnets. When creating the bastion, make sure to associate to it the SG allowing access to the database.
