# 15. (Optional) Set up Continuous Deployment with CodePipeline

This is where weâ€™ll automate the building of our images from our GitHub repository. Once images are built and tested (using built-in Laravel unit and integration tests), they will be deployed in production without further clicking.
Containers will be replaced in sequence using a deployment pattern called Blue-Green deployment, so we get absolutely no downtime.

*Coming soon*
