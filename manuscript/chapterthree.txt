# **3. Create a key pair to be used by your EC2 instances**


It is recommended to create a new SSH key pair for all EC2 instances of this new project, still using the CLI:


```no-highlight
   # Create the key pair and extract the private key from the JSON response
   aws ec2 create-key-pair
       --key-name=laravelaws
       --query 'KeyMaterial'
       --output text > laravelaws.pem

   # Assign appropriate permissions to the key file for it to be usable
   chmod 400 laravelaws.pem
```


Remember that AWS won&rsquo;t store SSH keys for you and you are responsible for storing and sharing them securely.
